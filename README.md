## About the Project
This is a passion project & this has to be maintained as much as possible in order for the longevity of the AddOn. It is solo-developed, but some very kind people from the community have already started contributing.

[Pull Requests](https://github.com/DaleHuntGB/MinimapStats/pulls) are welcome, but I ask that you maintain the structure & layout of my code. Additionally, not all Pull Requests made will be accepted. Anything added is another thing to maintain.

If you find [Issues](https://github.com/DaleHuntGB/MinimapStats/issues), please raise them appropriately and provide as much context as possible. If you have error codes, they help tremendously.
